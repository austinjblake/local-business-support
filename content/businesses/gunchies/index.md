Ok so I’ve been trying to figure a way to help supplement my bartenders lost tip wages since this mandatory closure.

 I never want to ask anyone for anything for free so here is what I have come up with: 

I will be selling gift cards (payment must be made through Venmo). I will be giving 25% of all sales of these cards to my employees. Obviously the remaining % will go towards paying for the cost of goods and the hourly wages I will incur. 

In this scenario you (my customers) will get equal value for your $ spent and I will have immediate funds available to disperse to employees. Please put “Pick up” or “Mail” and your address when you make payment. I will cover postage. Pick ups just need to call when they come down to get them. Unemployment will not pay their bills entirely and this is what I can do to help. 

Thank you all who have supported my business and other businesses during this time. Thank you for being amazing family and friends. I love you all.
