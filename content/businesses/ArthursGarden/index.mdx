Arthur’s Deli in Rock Island is getting very little business today. Now is the perfect time to stop by for a meal! Walk-in and order. They are using new gloves for every transaction and wiping doors and counters after each customer comes and goes.

Go get yourself the best sandwich in town!

And be sure to tell my amazing fiancé, Amanda, that Tyler says hello!
