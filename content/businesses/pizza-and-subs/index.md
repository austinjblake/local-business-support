Obviously we are all facing new challenges. Our utmost concern is keeping our employees, customers and everyone's family safe. As I'm sure everyone is now aware, the Governor of Illinois has shut down restaurants for dine in service beginning Tuesday March 17th.

Temporarily, we will changing our hours to 11-8 daily.

We will still be providing delivery and curbside pickup services. Our delivery area will remain the same. For safety precautions, our drivers will be changing gloves and using fresh pens at each location. We do ask that if you are a business or an apartment complex, that you come and meet the driver at the door or outside. We will be requiring credit cards for all deliveries.

For curbside, we will only be taking credit card payments over the phone when you call in your order. Our doors will be locked. Call when you arrive and we will bring the food out to the car, once again using fresh gloves and pens for each transaction. This is a first for us, so please be patient with us as we work out the kinks.

Keep in mind that we do offer half baked calzones and pizza for pickup and delivery. They both are freezer friendly and can be cooked at a later time.

Be safe Quad Cities.
