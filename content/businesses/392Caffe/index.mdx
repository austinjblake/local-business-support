## #Team392 needs your support

Dear Customers, Guests, Friends, Family, Acquaintances, Fans, Followers, and Peers,

These are some crazy times we're living through, and we're worried that some of our amazing team won't make it through this ordeal without your help. Beyond the shares, likes, reposts, comments, retweets, recommendations, and reviews of 392Caffe on Social Media, our crew will need financial support to get through this time of dramatically reduced income.

You all have grown to love #Team392! From the first time they greeted you at our door, to the first time they remembered your name and drink order, to the countless other occasions that they‚Äôve poured into your life, the people of 392 have become great acquaintances, friends, even family to you over time. The love is reciprocal.

As we enter these unprecedented times of uncertainty and financial hardships on the service industry specifically, we, Jay & Jenna, are asking for your help. It is not easy to find people like ours. It is not easy to retain people like ours. It is only by love and respect that we have adopted all of our employees into our family, trained them well, and allowed them to excel in hospitality and relationship building. Our employees/family/team is compensated above what most of their peers in the hospitality industry are, and we feel that they‚Äôre worth even more! They receive all of the generous tips that you leave every visit as a supplemental source of income, and as anyone else in a service industry job, are super appreciative of the extra compensation! Those extra funds really add to their livelihood! As we face this forthcoming economic uncertainty, we want to care first and foremost for our employees, and their livelihoods.

## HERE'S WHERE YOU COME IN

We are asking for your support to help us support our team. We know this crisis won‚Äôt last forever, and we‚Äôll be back on our feet before long, but we don‚Äôt want to risk losing any of our team. We also can‚Äôt risk our team not being able to make ends meet. There are unemployment benefits available to them if it comes to that, but they will only cover a percentage of their wage without tips. Unfortunately as a small business we can not afford to pay them while we are not generating "normal" revenue. We‚Äôre a small, family-run business that has assumed the risk of entrepreneurship. Our employees didn‚Äôt sign up for the risks associated with entrepreneurship; ie risk of losing everything. So we don‚Äôt want them to have to deal with that stress. Bottom line: We can't risk losing our team.

## HERES OUR CRAZY PLAN

If every time you come in, you throw a buck in the tip jar, sign up for a buck/day membership/donation. If you throw a couple bucks in the jar, sign up for a couple bucks/day! If you throw a fat $5 or a super generous $10 (they‚Äôre totally worth it! üôåüòç) sign up for a $5 or $10/day membership! This is an auto-recurring ‚Äútip‚Äù ‚Äúdonation‚Äù ‚Äúsupport‚Äù ‚Äústimulus‚Äù for your favorite crew of baristas/hospitality people/kitchen crew/friends/fam/etc.. THIS WOULD BE AMAZING!

In theory, if we had 500 ‚Äúthrow in‚Äù \$2/day, we would be able to cover our payroll + Supplement their "Tips" during these crazy times! Our crew would be able to not worry about their job/bills/future, and stay safe at work/home to weather this storm. Also, if we had our crew covered, we would organize "Small Groups" of us that would go out and volunteer our time in the community! We would sanitize playgrounds, clean up our neighborhoods, etc.. Thoughts?

Asking for support is hard for us. We‚Äôre very much a ‚ÄúGo-Getter‚Äù team! Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt see much of a silver lining in this situation. Except for you! You‚Äôre the reason we show up every day! You‚Äôre the reason we practice and advance at our craft! You‚Äôre the reason we employ such amazing people! You're the reason we have a business!

Jay & Jenna Sanders
